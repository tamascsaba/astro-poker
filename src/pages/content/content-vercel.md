### Vercel.

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a platform to deploy frontend apps and static sites. They support most modern Javascript frameworks, such as React, Svelte and Vue. Their onboarding process is great, and I highly recommend them. Read more in the [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).

For this demo, Vercel is connected to our [git repo](https://github.com/magnuswahlstrand/astro-supabase-vercel), and builds and deploys a new version of the site whenever new code is published. Vercel can automatically detect that our app is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
