### Astro.

According to their [website](https://astro.build/), they are
> ... are a web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

They do this by providing excellent support for either completely static sites (SSG), or using server-side rendering ([SSR](https://astro.build/blog/experimental-server-side-rendering/)). In a way, they are more similar to traditional web frameworks such as PHP and Ruby on Rails, than for example a single page applications written in React.

Astro supports content written with HTML and CSS, as well as Markdown. If dynamic content is needed, it is easy to enable integration with the most common web frameworks such as React, Svelte and Vue. They also support [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is an extension of Markdown with dynamic elements.

In this app, I use HTML, CSS (Tailwind) and markdown files. Astro supports multiple ways of [deploying](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) your app, out of the box, including [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). In this demo we use the latter.
