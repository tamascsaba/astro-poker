The site is based on [**Astro**](https://astro.build/), which is really good framework for
mix static site generation **(SSG)** and server side rendering **(SSR)** with using multiple frontend frameworks.

I use [**angular**](https://angular.io/), [**react**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**svelte**](https://svelte.io/). Styles made by [**tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/), is used for realtime communication. The app is deployed to
[**Vercel**](https://vercel.com)

### How it works.
You can create a room with the big blue button. If you do, you will redirect to a magic poker room and after that feel free to invite your team mates. Have a good game. ðŸ¥°

### More.
If you enjoyed this app, or want to learn more. Have a look at the [**source code**](https://github.com/tamascsaba/astro-poker) or send me a DM.
